## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is my first fully built web API application so of course I had to dedicate it to one of my favoirte hobbies. I used the D&D 5th Edition Web API to retrieve most of the data (https://www.dnd5eapi.co). This API did not include images or special captions so I added my own from the official D&D website. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how it important it is to start small and work your way up when it comes to more complex projects. Originally I wanted to jump right into displaying deeper parts of the API data but learned that I needed to start small and make sure I was accessing the JSON data correctly. I would have loved to spend more time building out the design of the app to be more aesthetically appealing, however with the limited time that I had I knew the priority was to make sure that the application functioned properly. 

Completing this project was a great stepping stone for me as it showed that I could now dive into more interesting projects that I could be passionate about. Coming out of this I feel much more confident with JavaScript and accessing API data that I'm ready to take on the next project.
